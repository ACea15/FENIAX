Metadata-Version: 2.1
Name: FEM4INAS
Version: 0.0.0
Summary: FEM4INAS is an aeroelastic toolbox written and parallelized in Python, which acts as a post-processor of commercial software such as MSC Nastran. Arbitrary FE models built for linear aeroelastic analysis are enhanced with geometric nonlinear effects, flight dynamics and linearized state-space solutions about nonlinear equilibrium.
