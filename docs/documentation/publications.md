# Research goals
## Key topics
### Geometrically nonlinear aeroelastic analysis using complex GFEMs

- Airframe integrity: flutter or divergence assessment.
- Multidisciplinary design optimisation.
### Max performance:
- Critical for time-domain simulations.
- JAX Just in Time Compilation (JIT)
- Code vectorisation and parallelisation.
- Branchless programming.
- Run on accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, etc.).
### Derivatives of aeroelastic analysis for design optimisation.
- Using JAX algorithmic differentiation.
### Uncertainty quantification via Montecarlo
